# On Premise Kubernetes
There are many reasons that the natural inclination to look at the cloud for execution of [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) data science analytics workloads may not be the best first choice for some organizations but [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/) still shows the way [forward](https://github.com/cncf/landscape/blob/master/README.md#trail-map) ([Interactive version](https://landscape.cncf.io/)) towards structuring both infrastructure and applications to embrace on-premise environments that enable either eventual or simultaneous scale out to cloud based services.

See [Awesome AI on Kubernetes](https://github.com/CognonicLabs/awesome-AI-kubernetes) for some specific information on data science workloads on Kubernetes.

Here, we will be focusing on Kubernetes infrastructure and architecture to support on-premise orchestration of [Awesome AI on Kubernetes](https://github.com/CognonicLabs/awesome-AI-kubernetes) type of workloads.
